# Inputs
  Positive integer 0 < X <= 2000 - the amount of cash which Pooja wishes to withdraw.
  Nonnegative number 0<= Y <= 2000 with two digits of precision - Pooja's initial account balance.
   
#Code : 
   def transaction(amt, bal):
    if amt>bal:
        return "insuficient balance"
    else:
        if amt%5==0:
            rem = bal-amt-.50
            return rem
        else:
            return bal
