Problem Statement : 
  Check the given string is palindrome or not, If palindrome then return True else False.
  palindrome : alphabet from starting and from ending is same in string then it is called palindrome.

Examples : 
  For inputString = "aabaa", the output should be
   checkPalindrome(inputString) = true;
   
  For inputString = "abac", the output should be
  checkPalindrome(inputString) = false;
  
  For inputString = "a", the output should be
  checkPalindrome(inputString) = true.
  
 Logic : 
  simply turn your string from ending to starting and match your turned string with given string if they both are equal then it is Palindrome else NOT.
  
  
Solution : 
  def checkPalindrome(inputString):
    if inputString==inputString[::-1]:             #This line will check your turned string and given string are same or not, (inputString[::-1] is turned your string from ending to satrting.).
        return True
    else:
        return False
