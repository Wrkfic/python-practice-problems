Problem-Statement : 
  Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.
  
  Example : 
    For year = 1905, the output should be
    centuryFromYear(year) = 20;
    For year = 1700, the output should be
    centuryFromYear(year) = 17.
    
  Logic : 
    if year divided by 100 and it's reminder is 0 then century willl be the first 2 digit of your year
    otherwise we only need first 2 digit of year and and 1 in to your result that will be your answer.
    
    
Solution : 
  def centuryFromYear(year):             #Define your function name centuryFromYear and it takes a one argument named year
    cen=0                                #define one variable name cen which will represent century
    if year%100==0:
        cen+=year/100
    else:
        cen=year//100 +1
    return cen
